==Problem==

Fake marks cards continue to be a recurring problem. A recent  case (https://goo.gl/CTuvN2) found 400+ people who secured jobs using such certificates and marks cards and the total beneficiaries of this scam are estimated to be in the thousands. Various universities have proposed solutions such as NFC chips on cards linked to a cloud server (Mangalore Univeristy news report from October 20, 2017: https://goo.gl/GdAEhW). NFC chips require physical changes in the printing process and are costly and moreover cannot be used for existing marks cards. Verifying the validity of these cards publicly is also not simple if each university has its own setup. If we were to overcome adoption difficulties and make all universities use a single secure cloud service, setting up and maintaining such a service would involve significant costs. And even in this scenario, we cannot guarantee that the records on this central server have not been tampered.
